Adobe has worked with both organizations to bring professional publishing techniques to the Open Web Platform and we look forward to working together to set the roadmap for the future of publishing. The work on Web Publications will serve to continue the W3C’s efforts to shape the way that content is delivered—from classic publications, to documents, to any content destined for distribution.",

			"quote": "The European Digital Reading Lab (EDRLab) is excited at the prospect of participating to the evolution of publishing standards and associated technologies with experts from two complementary domains, publishing and Web. Since 2015, we are promoting interoperability and accessibility via a broader use of EPUB in Europe. We believe that W3C support will encourage a broader adoption of EPUB 3, beyond the book industry, and may position EPUB as THE publishing format or any type of document. We are also confident that the work on Portable Web Publications, as initiated by W3C and IDPF experts inside the DPUB IG, associated with the work of the Readium Foundation on modern open-source reading software, will bring great benefits to readers in the coming years, including print-disabled people.",

We can now return to focusing more on publishing as a means to share and communicate knowledge, and less on scrambling to adapt to the plethora of new devices and modalities. We believe the standards of the two organizations overlap more than they diverge. We look forward to the continuing evolution of publishing, wherever it happens",
